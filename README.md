##In todayâ€™s digital world, real-time collaboration has become an essential feature in productivity applications. The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor aims to provide a seamless and interactive environment 

where multiple users can work on a document simultaneously. This project, developed as part of an internship with CodTech, focuses on building a dynamic, responsive, and scalable application using modern web

technologies.The goal of this project is to develop a web-based document editor that allows multiple users to edit the same document in real-time. The system ensures synchronization between users, preventing

conflicts while providing features like version control, role-based access, and offline editing capabilities. The editor will function similarly to Google Docs, enabling users to create, modify, and collaborate on 

text-based documents efficiently.##
